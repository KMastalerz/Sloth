1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,220
From this tiny Malaysian fishing village,
these 16 Americans are beginning the

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,560
adventure of a lifetime.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,280
And

4
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
right here, a beautiful but dangerous
jungle in the middle of

5
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,590
Elves.

6
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,710
No creature comforts.

7
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,610
They are wiping the slate clean.

8
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,190
Turn

9
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
to adapt or they are voted off.

10
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,460
In

11
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,770
these 16 people, one survivor.

12
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,640
The 16 contestants have been separated
into two tribes named after the beaches

13
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,540
where they will live.

14
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,990
Sean Kenna, a neurologist from Long
Island.

15
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,990
Kelly Wigglesworth, a river guide from Las
Vegas.

16
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,090
Rudy Bosch, a retiree

17
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,440
three-year-old cancer survivor from San
Francisco.

18
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,680
Richard Hatch, a corporate communications
consultant from Rhode Island.

19
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,480
Susan Hock, a truck driver from Wisconsin.

20
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,380
Dirk Bean, a young dairy farmer, also from
Wisconsin.

21
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,560
And Stacy Stillman, a litigation attorney
from San Francisco.

22
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,060
Jervis Peterson, a YMCA basketball coach
from Philadelphia.

23
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,400
Colleen Haskell, an advertising student
from Miami.

24
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,620
B.B.

25
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,540
Anderson, a real estate developer from
Kansas City.

26
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,520
Ramona Gray, a biochemist from New Jersey.

27
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,480
Gretchen Cordy, a preschool teacher from
Tennessee.

28
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,700
Greg Buis, a recent Ivy League graduate
from Colorado.

29
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,660
Jenna Lewis, a single mother and full-time
student from New Hampshire.

30
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,660
And Joel Kluge, a health club consultant
from Little Rock.

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,440
A few years

32
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,520
ago, this group met for the first time in
a small fishing village on the coast of

33
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,900
Borneo.

34
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,300
Their minds racing with questions,
wondering, can I do this?

35
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,520
This is more than just a test of survival
skills.

36
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,080
It's also a test of social skills.

37
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,900
Here, it's the impressions you make on the
other castaways that determines your fate.

38
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,280
Under the rules, one tribe must visit
tribal council every three days with a

39
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
single purpose.

40
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,080
Vote one of their own members off the
island.

41
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,060
To win, you must survive the island,
survive the boat, and ultimately, survive

42
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,660
each other.

43
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,610
Paddling over, we had two or three of
those boxes in the water, dragging them

44
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,530
behind the raft.

45
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,410
And that is dumb.

46
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,570
I said, let's get them boxes aboard.

47
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,650
It'll be a lot easier.

48
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,450
You know, that's dead weight you got.

49
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,030
He was yelling at everybody.

50
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,590
Let's lose the box.

51
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,810
Cut it loose now.

52
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,610
He may be 72 years old and an ex-Navy
SEAL, but that doesn't mean that this is

53
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,150
his world.

54
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,050
Rudy, Sean, Stacy, can we take like 15
minutes and just talk before we do

55
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,370
anything?

56
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,390
Can we piss first?

57
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,450
Just a suggestion.

58
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,540
Should we take a break?

59
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,080
No, keep battling.

60
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,000
One break in a time, one water break in a
time.

61
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,230
I don't like being on the water all that
much.

62
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,510
So, I mean, the whole motion like this.

63
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,510
And we're rowing.

64
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,530
We have like 100 pounds of stuff on the
raft.

65
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,970
I just, I started heaving.

66
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:26,670
Good job.

67
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:27,750
Good job.

68
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,810
Way not to put on it.

69
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,190
I'm used to being in a lab with my lab put
on, in the air conditioning.

70
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,730
But this is like outdoors, 24-7.

71
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,890
And you're exerting energy like almost all
of that time.

72
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
This is just day one.

73
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,020
Should

74
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,830
we start moving the left up?

75
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,510
Hey, let's discuss some things, man.

76
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,450
Let's figure some things out.

77
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,130
Here's what we plan on doing.

78
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,890
High tide is that line right there.

79
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,530
See that line?

80
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:03,970
Uh-huh.

81
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,530
So it shouldn't come up to here.

82
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,030
Right.

83
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,910
And this piece of bamboo back here, we can
lay it from up here over to there.

84
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,110
Oh, that guy's a similar clearing, but
none of us.

85
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,950
Actually, it's before we build the
shelter, just knock that whole...

86
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,610
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,890
No, I mean, this is enough crap on us to
say that.

88
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,910
What's the first thing we need to do?

89
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,430
Okay.

90
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:19,970
Shelter.

91
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,050
We need a latrine.

92
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,690
Okay, so we don't need fire tonight?

93
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,430
Is that what we're saying?

94
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:24,630
No.

95
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,290
That's an option.

96
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,390
We got enough water to make it tonight,
you think?

97
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,330
You guys, I think the first thing we ought
to do is talk about how we're going to do

98
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,310
whatever we're going to do.

99
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:32,670
That's what we're doing.

100
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,590
Talk about the process.

101
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,530
All right.

102
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,750
Listen, listen.

103
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,750
Let me give you a quick.

104
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,450
The cap will be right there.

105
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,650
We'll clear these leaves up.

106
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,050
That's a flat piece of ground.

107
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,250
The latrine will be down there.

108
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,950
The wind's hitting me in the back right
now.

109
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,450
So we're saying we need a latrine, and we
just need a clear place to sleep.

110
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,610
Is that all we want tonight?

111
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,170
Off the ground.

112
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:50,850
Off the ground.

113
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,550
Let's check the bus.

114
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,250
Let's see what we've got.

115
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,110
Let's see what we've got.

116
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,330
Let's see what we've got.

117
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:55,530
What do I say?

118
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,790
There might be a blowtorch in there.

119
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,370
We need a bathroom.

120
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,770
Are you guys all done talking?

121
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:01,850
Yeah, we're going to ask.

122
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,030
Huh?

123
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,710
I'm done, though.

124
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,810
I'm going to open up a box.

125
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,030
I'm looking for freedom, man.

126
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,210
Rich, I appreciate what he's trying to do
as far as bring the team together and

127
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,810
stuff, because that's one thing that needs
to happen.

128
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,490
I think he's got some good skills in that
area, and unfortunately, people like that

129
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,050
annoy me.

130
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,050
I'm just thinking.

131
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,990
I think we're off to a bad start.

132
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,530
Why?

133
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,830
Because we're not talking?

134
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:29,290
Sometimes, though, Richard, you kind of
got to do things and talk as you go along,

135
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,070
and sometimes things can't be that planned
out.

136
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,330
I agree with you.

137
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,750
I agree with you.

138
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,530
The problem with having no conversation
whatsoever or lots of people talking about

139
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,210
different things is that nobody's working
toward a particular goal.

140
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,430
Not the silly little stuff about, oh,
who's going to sleep?

141
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,250
What are we going to do?

142
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,130
But why are we here?

143
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,850
And what's the point?

144
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,270
And if we don't...

145
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,890
Oh, I figured that out before I come here.

146
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,310
For you.

147
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,430
But you haven't?

148
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,810
And I have for me.

149
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,550
But we haven't for us.

150
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,630
And for the next seven ejections, 21 days,
we have to function together or we fail.

151
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,250
What do you think we're doing now?

152
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,550
Not functioning together at all.

153
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,890
I'm a redneck.

154
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,890
And I don't know corporate world at all.

155
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,470
And corporate world ain't going to work
out here in the bush.

156
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,050
No, and I'm not talking corporate world.

157
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,210
I'm talking creating a team.

158
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,690
And working together.

159
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,150
We're doing good.

160
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,490
But, see, so the creating team is actually
putting all of our hands together and

161
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,270
walking and...

162
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:19,710
Not hands.

163
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,950
All of us knowing what we're doing.

164
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,750
The head thing, yeah.

165
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,430
But that's...

166
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,850
Action, man.

167
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,730
Action, Richard.

168
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,250
Yeah.

169
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,950
Action.

170
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,670
You don't want to act ahead.

171
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,090
I'm good to go, survival-wise.

172
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,290
People-wise, it'll be a little more
challenging.

173
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,570
But I've got the million-dollar check
written already.

174
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,910
I mean, I'm the winner.

175
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,810
And it's that kind of cocky attitude that
makes people really hate your gut.

176
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:48,090
So that's the kind of thing I've really
got to keep under wraps.

177
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,630
But it's just, how do I get there from
here?

178
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,750
Oh,

179
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,360
look at this, folks!

180
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:05,760
Woo!

181
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,260
What is it?

182
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,180
If this is carotene, and we're going to
take one of those lamps...

183
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,480
Oh, we can make torches and stuff out of
twine.

184
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,420
We can twine all the time.

185
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,660
What is that?

186
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,500
We match it.

187
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,700
Yeah, look.

188
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,520
It's definitely biscuits, because we've
got corn.

189
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,460
Oh, look.

190
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,420
We've got a frying pan.

191
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,640
Oh, we are so set.

192
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,540
Look, I'm shaking it.

193
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,340
Can anyone hear the biscuits?

194
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,260
Oh-ho!

195
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,560
We've got a clean flat!

196
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,020
Woo!

197
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,600
That's all the train.

198
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,000
I said we dig a hole, put this here, knock
the port out of the bottom.

199
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,340
Then we can just keep moving in.

200
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,040
We've got a nice hole.

201
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,440
We should just sit down and have a talk
about what the hell we're going to do.

202
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,220
Can I help?

203
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,760
When I asked earlier about having a
conversation, that's what I was talking

204
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,040
about.

205
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,300
And I really can help with how we can do
that.

206
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,540
You guys, we came over here to talk.

207
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,360
What happens when people get together is,
if they aren't all headed in the same

208
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,260
direction toward a particular goal, then
things that individuals do kind of get in

209
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,620
the way of the whole team.

210
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,780
And I think it's really, really important
that what we decide be decided as a group.

211
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,080
So if you hear somebody saying something
and you're all aggravated with them, stop.

212
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,440
Don't try to make your point and try and
help them make theirs.

213
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,560
So for example, you know Sean, what do you
think the main point of what I'm trying to

214
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,280
say now is?

215
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,180
I've been daydreaming, thinking, what am I
going to eat?

216
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,740
That's a real big way to figure it out.

217
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,140
As long as they can hit the middle of this
hole, we don't freeze.

218
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,360
A long...

219
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,020
Start here.

220
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,880
We start here.

221
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,160
We go back to the other stream down there.

222
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,340
Here's where we are right here.

223
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,060
We have to go across the stream.

224
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,660
We go across one stream, two streams,
three streams.

225
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,080
Alright.

226
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,310
You know that?

227
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,670
Okay, is this the path?

228
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,030
Well, it said newly cut path.

229
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,170
It was newly cut.

230
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,550
Trail washes out.

231
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,990
Oh, the trail washes out.

232
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:41,950
Oh, what?

233
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,170
No?

234
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,350
Why don't you stay there for a minute.

235
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,170
Let me walk to keep you in sight.

236
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:49,930
Okay.

237
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,030
To see if I see anything that resembles
anything.

238
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,710
You see anything?

239
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,250
Look at here.

240
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,170
Well, I mean, come here and look at it.

241
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,470
Okay, ready?

242
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,730
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

243
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,190
Yeah.

244
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,110
There we are.

245
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,530
Go ahead.

246
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,350
Alright.

247
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,790
Way to go, baby.

248
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,890
Don't let me drop sweat in that.

249
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,370
Okay, we're almost full.

250
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,190
You know, we could never do this, but you
know what?

251
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,370
The thought crossed my mind.

252
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:23,750
What?

253
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,910
As long as you and I always know where the
water is...

254
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,210
We've got control of the water map.

255
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,790
No one else will be able to vote you or I
out.

256
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,350
We're not giving up the secrets of the
water supply.

257
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:35,990
That's right.

258
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,370
This thing is Viagra.

259
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,150
Viagra.

260
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,090
That's his nickname.

261
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:01,870
You got to...

262
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,030
You know, you got to do what you got to
do, right?

263
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,420
If we don't keep some humor, we'll go mad.

264
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,380
Good

265
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,360
job.

266
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,060
The hardest part is hanging around with
all these young kids.

267
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,240
I don't even know what MTV means, you
know?

268
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,220
And I'm used to being in the military and
one guy stands up, he gives an order and

269
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
there's no back talk.

270
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,860
You know, like yesterday, everybody's
trying to run the show.

271
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,220
And if they'd let one person do it, we'd
be much better off.

272
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,820
But trying to keep them all shut up is
hard.

273
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,780
If they listened to me, they'd all have
haircuts and everything else, you know?

274
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,860
We'd be in formation in the morning and
all that kind of stuff.

275
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,780
But they're not going to do that.

276
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,000
I got to fit in, not them.

277
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,080
You know, there's more of them than there
is of me.

278
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,660
Hey, you got a pierced nipple, eh?

279
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,240
Yeah, I got the old pierced nipple thing.

280
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,400
How does that feel?

281
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,700
Pretty edgy for a doctor, right?

282
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,680
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,220
I thought I was making it with the hair.

284
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,120
And then this morning, man, when I ran my
hands through it, I fell from a couple of,

285
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,340
like, softball-sized knots in it.

286
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,980
I'm like, nah, they're going to come out
now.

287
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,680
I was doing something.

288
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,960
I don't even remember how I did it.

289
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,720
Bated on won't hurt it.

290
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,380
Yeah, so we'll give it a little shot of
bated on, too.

291
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,680
Please.

292
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,720
I think these are the only sponges we
have, so I'm just going to keep reusing a

293
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,000
little bit.

294
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,280
Yeah.

295
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,060
Okay.

296
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,760
I've been thrashing around like I'm 35,
instead of acting my age.

297
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:17,820
But we have a doctor in our tribe, Sean,
and he did a wonderful job of bandaging me

298
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,080
up.

299
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,920
I think one of the problems with aging is
the thinning of the skin, darn it.

300
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,760
And so I think I'm maybe getting a little
more banged up than some of the younger

301
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,060
ones.

302
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,780
I'm able to do something bizarre, but
we're getting there.

303
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,460
Try this.

304
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,620
I don't know.

305
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,840
Heavier.

306
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,740
That's a little sharper though.

307
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,520
He's awesome.

308
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,760
Oh.

309
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,540
That ain't going to work.

310
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,040
Here's the therapist version of Bye Bye
Blues.

311
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,920
If I can remember it, I will.

312
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,080
Bye, bye, blues.

313
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,740
Thanks to Prozac.

314
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,500
Bye, bye, blues.

315
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,160
Give me Paxil.

316
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,220
They'll bring birds sing.

317
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,560
Sun is shining.

318
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,760
No more whining.

319
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,420
My limb through.

320
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,220
Da-da-da-da-da.

321
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,680
Light is as hell, but I'm swell.

322
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,900
Bye, bye, bye, blues.

323
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,240
Yeah, it's awesome.

324
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:20,820
Awesome.

325
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,000
Fantastic.

326
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,320
Well, the fish traps were hanging from the
boat that we were coming over here.

327
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,980
And when we were tossed into the sea on
the raft and we could take whatever we

328
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,040
could get our hands on, we grabbed three
or four fish traps and a bunch of rat

329
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,420
traps.

330
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,480
And so we stuck the rat traps out the
first night, and boom, we got a rat in

331
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:43,860
each of them.

332
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,310
I didn't sleep at all.

333
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,410
I mean, we closed our eyes.

334
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,490
We kept hearing noises and, like, cooking
sounds.

335
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,470
And we were like, okay, what's his name?

336
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,990
Joel woke up, a rat was, like, in his ear.

337
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,190
I heard something squeaking in my ear
every time a rat was trying to get on the

338
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,510
raft.

339
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,450
Or get near us or get at something.

340
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,090
I mean, everything was moving.

341
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,890
Well, we're just going along with the
beach here and just identifying whatever

342
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,490
we can use for the shelter, the roof.

343
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,130
And we're a little irritated that none of
the others don't want to help carry stuff,

344
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,870
but that's okay.

345
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,290
We need five more of these.

346
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:55,790
Bebe.

347
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,890
He's a character, man.

348
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,630
I don't think he likes me much.

349
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:01,950
Just these.

350
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,850
No, you don't understand.

351
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,150
I've got to have this thought out and
positioned right.

352
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:06,470
Okay.

353
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,310
Just, just, Joel, trust me.

354
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,590
I'm not, I'm not the one bitching.

355
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:11,730
No, I know.

356
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,890
I mean, I'm, I'm fine.

357
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,120
He's talking to me about monkey business.

358
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,180
I can't sleep, so I'm usually up on the
job.

359
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,040
Just being the whip.

360
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,980
We got a lot of lazy people, if you don't
know the truth.

361
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,240
You can't do it all yourself.

362
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,580
You know, I asked Colleen to straighten
this out for me.

363
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,380
And here it is.

364
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,020
It's the only thing she had to do today.

365
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,180
She can't have lazy people.

366
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,140
He had been out there, you know, all
morning long.

367
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,420
And, um, you know, it was hot.

368
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,740
Baby, I thought we said this was the time
of day we were going to see out of the

369
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,060
sun.

370
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,900
Well, but for some of the people, it's
been all day that way.

371
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,240
All right, it's your turn.

372
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,740
You tell me what you're doing here, and
I'll help you.

373
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,240
You hold it up, and I'll do it quick.

374
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,380
I promise you, I'll do it quick.

375
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,920
That, you know, that's the right way to do
it quick.

376
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,880
We won't have near enough line to build
the roof and do that if we do all this.

377
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,980
It's an off hammer.

378
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,020
Anyway, don't stop now, but...

379
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,960
I think there's plenty.

380
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,920
And I'm gonna roll that up for you, too.

381
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,280
We can't, like, get burned out, though.

382
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,100
I'm not burned out.

383
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,780
I know, but you will be if you spend all
day out in the sun.

384
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,020
No, no.

385
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,820
I never get burned out.

386
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,160
You don't know me.

387
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,920
I don't know you, but I know human beings.

388
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,580
Okay.

389
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,140
I like working as a hobby.

390
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,620
Honest to God, how about 15 minutes,
though?

391
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:55,940
What?

392
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,960
Get down for 15 minutes.

393
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,880
Yeah, but I want to get...

394
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,720
I want to get this thing stabilized.

395
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,720
But, Phoebe, look...

396
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,500
So at least...

397
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,600
See, let me just explain.

398
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,200
I want to get this stabilized, so then
people can come in.

399
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,640
You know, with that light cord you got?

400
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,060
And we can tie these things down.

401
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:15,640
But until I get this bounce out of this, I
want to put a support there, in the middle

402
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,860
here, and right there.

403
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,700
Because if not, we got to take bounce out
of this.

404
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,420
I just think we have plenty of time.

405
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,020
I thought we were going to try to stay
competitive.

406
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,700
And if you work all day and you're burnt
at the end of the day, we're not going to

407
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,220
be competitive.

408
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,900
Take a break, and if it bounces a little
tonight, then we'll fix it tomorrow.

409
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,180
I'm going to keep working.

410
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,680
We are.

411
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,140
You're going to...

412
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,520
Are you going to work?

413
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,440
No, I'm not.

414
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,160
Yeah, you are.

415
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,190
Oh, my.

416
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,290
You're doing fine.

417
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,050
Too much paper?

418
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:01,790
Yeah.

419
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,940
You're a man, B.

420
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,520
No.

421
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,080
I just...

422
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,220
We're both a man.

423
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,220
And made it happen.

424
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,280
The fire started because I had bought a
set of glasses with me.

425
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,020
I was going to do it, and Gretchen said,
why don't I do it?

426
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,960
I know how to do it, too.

427
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,500
So I said, great.

428
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,620
Nice, guys.

429
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,980
Nice split up and everything.

430
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,240
Amen.

431
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,060
Good work.

432
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,920
And she took my glasses and started the
fire.

433
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,520
You did well, Gretchen.

434
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,380
If we get fire, it means we're going to
have a hot meal in our stomach, which is

435
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,700
going to bring up tea morale.

436
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,620
That first hot meal might be rat soup,
which I'm, like, looking forward to very

437
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,540
much because there's nothing wrong with
the rat.

438
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,400
All a rat is is a squirrel without a fuzzy
tail.

439
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,600
Let's just work with this.

440
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:53,920
Okay.

441
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,900
I'm thinking that's just...

442
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,720
If we could just work with this, I mean,
we're getting a ton of smoke.

443
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,060
Now we just got to figure out...

444
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,480
Oh, and start that piece of wood?

445
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,180
So if we get a piece of bamboo, someone
sits here and pulls the bamboo right here

446
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,980
with the kindling in it.

447
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,920
With the kindling in it.

448
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:05,880
You know what I'm saying?

449
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,300
There you go.

450
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,010
Come on, Dirk.

451
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,270
Take

452
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,790
a break, man.

453
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,470
We made a lot of smoke, but no fire.

454
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,990
I think that it would have been nice if we
had fire.

455
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,670
We're not going to catch fish unless we
have fire to cook it.

456
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,090
And I think that if we had fire, we could
have spent a lot of time sitting around

457
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,770
the bonfire at night and maybe sing us
songs.

458
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,130
We have a ukulele, you know?

459
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,670
And that didn't happen, and I wish it did.

460
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,270
Throughout their time on the island, the
tribes will compete in a series of

461
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,790
challenges.

462
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,790
They'll receive messages notifying them of
these competitions at their tree mail.

463
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:29,910
Today's challenge is for both reward in
the form of 50 waterproof matches and

464
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,530
immunity.

465
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,210
When immunity, you stay on the island a
few days longer.

466
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,050
Lose, face tribal council, where you must
vote one member off the island.

467
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,910
Pam, just a reminder of your first night.

468
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,850
It looks so easy in the book.

469
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,190
Yes.

470
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,930
Why is it so hard to light?

471
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,450
Tonight, your tribe will carry the torch.

472
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,170
One tribe takes home the flame.

473
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,530
The other gives someone the boost.

474
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:10,670
Whoa!

475
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:15,470
Whoa, immunity challenge with time.

476
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,430
That's the competition is taking home the
flame.

477
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,730
But what's the competition?

478
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,990
We've got no freaking idea.

479
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,860
Welcome tribes to your first challenge.

480
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,380
Congratulations on your first night on the
island.

481
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,320
You should be very proud.

482
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,240
I know both of you guys have food.

483
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,620
You found some fresh water.

484
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,220
And I think, Pagong, you guys had fire.

485
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,680
Woo!

486
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,800
Yeah!

487
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,800
A lot of work to get fire, right?

488
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,180
Yeah.

489
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,820
Yeah, it takes a lot of work.

490
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,020
A lot.

491
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,880
With the threat of rain, always a
constant.

492
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,640
Even if you guys did have fire, you're
certainly not back there tending to them

493
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:56,880
now.

494
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,860
50 waterproof matches should certainly
make that a lot easier.

495
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,160
It's one of the things you're playing for
tonight.

496
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,540
The other is this.

497
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,780
I want everybody to touch this.

498
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,960
Get a good feel of this.

499
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,620
This is your life on the island.

500
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,400
This is the immunity idol.

501
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,360
Win this, you stay on the island a few
days longer.

502
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,900
Lose, you face tomorrow's tribal council
where one of you will be the first person

503
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,700
boated off the island.

504
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,320
Big enough stakes?

505
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,000
Oh yeah!

506
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,340
Okay, here's what we're doing.

507
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,320
There are two rafts about 150 feet out in
the water.

508
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,460
Your job is to get your raft back to the
beach.

509
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,980
Along the way, a series of torches both in
the water and on the land.

510
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,660
First team to light all their torches and
their side of the fire spirit wins

511
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,060
immunity.

512
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,800
Here are the rules.

513
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,640
Each tribe member has to have one hand on
the raft at all times.

514
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,700
At all times.

515
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,060
Nobody can swim ahead.

516
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,240
Nobody can fall behind.

517
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:47,960
The other rule?

518
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,440
You have to light every torch.

519
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,240
Don't put me in the position of having to
make a judgement call.

520
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:52,980
I don't want to.

521
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,300
There's too much at stake.

522
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,080
Clear?

523
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:55,980
Clear.

524
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,540
Alright.

525
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,820
Swim out to your rafts.

526
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,680
Wait for my signal.

527
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,550
Great competition.

528
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:00,950
Really close.

529
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,030
Begong.

530
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,830
You get fire in the form of 50 water for a
matchup.

531
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,560
Nice competition.

532
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,920
You know the drill.

533
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,880
You have a date with me tomorrow for the
tribal council.

534
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,660
Where one of you will be the first person
voted off.

535
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,080
Oh, he does?

536
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,080
He brought his bible?

537
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:47,720
Yeah, yeah.

538
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,620
I think he's pretty religious.

539
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,860
He was telling me he was a Jewish
minister.

540
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,180
Wash.

541
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,080
Before we got on the island here, I formed
opinions about people.

542
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,400
But I changed my mind just on that trip
in.

543
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
He's rich, for one.

544
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,080
I mean, this guy, he's strong.

545
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,040
He's smart.

546
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,640
This guy surprises me.

547
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,580
You know, he's fat, but he's good.

548
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,520
You can just lay it right over those.

549
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,640
I like Rudy.

550
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,420
I'm not bothered by his
straightforwardness at all.

551
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,920
I don't think it's even a problem.

552
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,880
I like it that he's saying, hey, do this,
or hey, do that.

553
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,240
But people are thinking of that as very
direct and arrogant.

554
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,200
That's the word I'm hearing.

555
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,920
And I'm thinking to myself, well, they
think he's arrogant.

556
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,880
Oh, my God.

557
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,780
I'm out of here.

558
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,480
Oh, my God.

559
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,120
What do we got?

560
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,920
The good news is we'll be having fire
tonight.

561
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,780
The bad news is one of us won't be here to
enjoy it.

562
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,460
We've got the tribal council tonight.

563
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,500
Pack your bags.

564
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,340
Get ready to go.

565
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,500
Which one it will be, the world will soon
know.

566
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,960
Unfortunately, we're going to have to vote
somebody off.

567
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,400
There's going to be a lot of tension.

568
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,680
And one of us is going to leave.

569
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,500
What time are we going to do this at?

570
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,440
We just said get ready to go.

571
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,020
Pack your bags.

572
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,720
Get ready to go.

573
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,300
I can't believe we have to pack up.

574
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,700
We're just getting settled.

575
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,680
Well, somebody's bored.

576
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,320
Somebody's gone.

577
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,260
So it's time to think about who are they
going to vote for?

578
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,300
Why are they going to vote?

579
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,780
I've narrowed it down to four.

580
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,040
I'm one of them.

581
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,280
Well, it could mean a lot.

582
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,560
Either staying or being voted out.

583
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,880
You know, last night's competition, I
really feel responsible.

584
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,940
Because I couldn't keep up.

585
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,500
And I was dragged totally off my feet.

586
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,740
I do feel that that stumble probably cost
us the immunity challenge.

587
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,720
And that's a big one.

588
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,840
Up until probably last night, I never gave
it a second thought about who I was going

589
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,460
to vote off.

590
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,420
Or if I got voted off.

591
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,200
But after last night, I thought about it
then.

592
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,200
And I decided then.

593
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,840
I feel pretty secure, actually, about the
vote tonight.

594
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,220
Kelly and I get along real well.

595
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,080
And we've been talking about strategy.

596
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,340
And, you know, who's not contributing as
much.

597
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,060
And who would be best to vote off.

598
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,060
And I think we've come to a mutual
decision.

599
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,080
And we've talked to Sue about it.

600
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,840
Stacy came up to me.

601
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,140
It's like, she don't like Rudy.

602
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,600
And she's like, oh, we think we're going
to vote for Rudy.

603
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,340
And we'll vote him off because she's so
barking.

604
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,280
Why anybody's too barking too bossy is
Stacy.

605
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,560
Because she doesn't move her ass.

606
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,060
The chicks think I'm voting for one person
and I'm not.

607
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,820
This is tribal council.

608
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,200
Where each week, one member will be voted
off the island.

609
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,300
Last night, in a crushing defeat, Tagi
lost the immunity challenge.

610
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,920
So tonight, they will come here and vote
the first person off.

611
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,800
It all begins with a dangerous hike
through the jungle.

612
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,880
With so little time to get acquainted,
everyone is vulnerable.

613
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,060
Rich's talk versus action approach may be
more annoying than helpful.

614
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,880
Sonia's tumble cost them dearly.

615
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,120
One thing's for certain, at tribal
council, you are held accountable for your

616
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,520
actions.

617
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,020
There will be a vote.

618
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,640
Someone is going home.

619
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,960
I see torches.

620
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,000
Oh, that looks pretty hairy.

621
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,820
Make your way around.

622
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,050
We begin tribal council with a ritual.

623
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,810
Behind each view is a torch.

624
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,150
I'd like you to grab the torch and
approach the fire.

625
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,630
Go ahead and dip your torches in the
flame.

626
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,310
Light them.

627
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,030
Put them back in their slot and take a
seat.

628
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,890
We do this because, as I'm sure you've
discovered, on the island, fire represents

629
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,310
life.

630
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,330
These torches now represent your life,
your identity here at tribal council.

631
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,930
The good news is you will take these
torches with you when you leave.

632
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,770
So you will have fire and you will bring
them back with you to each tribal council.

633
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:41,590
Go ahead and have a seat.

634
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,090
Well, leave it to me to state the obvious,
but this is not a place you want to be.

635
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,970
You tread in dangerous territory every
time you come here.

636
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,690
Tribal council is basically where you
account for your actions on the island.

637
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,650
Some of those actions will come back to
help you.

638
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,870
Some of them may come back to haunt you.

639
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,970
But tonight, based on those actions, one
of you will be the first person voted off

640
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,370
the island.

641
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,030
So, before we get to the vote, let's talk
about what's been going on.

642
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,690
I'm curious just about you guys getting
here and finding this place.

643
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,930
How was the journey over here?

644
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,330
Two deadly snakes.

645
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:13,950
Really?

646
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,030
Grand Canyon, mud flies.

647
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,650
It was great.

648
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:18,730
Fun.

649
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,310
We're still starving.

650
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,230
We still haven't eaten.

651
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,290
We've eaten, but not really eaten.

652
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,730
The competition is stiffer.

653
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,450
The competition we had last night was
tougher than I had anticipated.

654
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,570
How are you holding up physically?

655
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,290
Well, pretty well.

656
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,010
You know, I'll fight to the finish.

657
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,490
I have my blisters and footnotes, but I'm
doing okay.

658
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,730
What happened after Quest for Fire?

659
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,270
That was a great competition.

660
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,730
Obviously a lot at stake.

661
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,290
We came close.

662
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,050
We almost got them.

663
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,750
We came back.

664
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,150
We were right there.

665
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,070
We almost got them.

666
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,610
There's no way.

667
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,170
Alright guys, well, it's obviously a fun
group.

668
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,730
This is not a pleasant process.

669
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:00,070
And I know also from listening to you guys
talk that there are a lot of different

670
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,790
reasons why you're here.

671
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,030
Obviously a million dollars, big motivator
for anybody.

672
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,990
But I'm sensing there could be personal
reasons, different journeys you might be

673
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,650
on that this encompasses.

674
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:15,630
Whatever it is, to fulfill that agenda,
you have to survive tonight's Tribal

675
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:15,910
Council.

676
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,810
That's the way it's set up.

677
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,250
So, what we're going to do is vote.

678
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,390
And how it will work is, we'll come down
here.

679
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,210
We'll go across this bridge into our
voting confessional.

680
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,490
Write the name of the person you want to
vote off.

681
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,870
Large, clear letters.

682
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,150
Hold it up and speak your peace.

683
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:31,970
We can't hear you.

684
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:32,910
Fold it up.

685
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,330
Put it in the container.

686
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,750
Come back and take a seat.

687
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,770
Now, once the votes are tallied, the
decision is final.

688
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,570
And you have to leave the Tribal Council
area immediately.

689
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,110
It's time to vote.

690
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,370
You're first.

691
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,690
The

692
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,710
weakest link in the crew.

693
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,630
Tough call.

694
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,010
He's an ornery guy.

695
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,810
Doesn't really help that much.

696
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,550
For a Navy SEAL, he doesn't know how to
start fire.

697
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,650
And he just criticizes everything.

698
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,130
She's the reason we lost yesterday.

699
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:06,670
I

700
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:36,110
miss his skills and speaking his mind
openly.

701
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,340
...on the courage it's taken to get this
far.

702
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,380
There were a lot of steps along the way
any of you could have turned around.

703
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,660
Nobody did.

704
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,200
And in my book, that gives you bragging
rights for life.

705
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,760
So with that, I'll read the votes.

706
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,120
First vote.

707
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,380
Sonya.

708
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,410
Sonya.

709
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,160
Rudy.

710
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,760
Rudy.

711
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,700
Rudy.

712
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,400
Rudy.

713
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,140
That's three for Sonya and three for Rudy.

714
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,140
First person voted off the island.

715
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,160
I

716
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,540
need you to grab your torch and bring it
to me.

717
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,960
The tribe has spoken.

718
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,310
Well, to the rest of you, I guess, a
somber congratulations.

719
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,530
You've survived the tribal council.

720
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,290
You have fire.

721
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:10,330
You can head back to camp and I will see
you tomorrow for the next challenge.

722
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,290
Good night.

723
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,820
Next week on Survivor.

724
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,300
I've been working my ass off and a lot of
you have been laying on your ass watching

725
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:40,460
me.

726
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,380
Don't give me any of that.

727
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,980
Me and Richard got to be pretty good
friends.

728
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,640
Not in a homosexual way, that's for sure.

729
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,060
Well, I think this has been an awesome
experience.

730
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,680
Being the first to be voted out is a
little humiliating.

731
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,220
On the other hand, the team did the right
thing.

732
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,920
They're a terrific group of people.

733
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,540
They're very strong physically.

734
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,400
And I think in their shoes, I'd probably
do the same thing.

735
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:20,420
...

736
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,000
To be continued...
