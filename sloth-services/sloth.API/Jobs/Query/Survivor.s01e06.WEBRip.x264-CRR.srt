1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,450
Sixteen Americans forced to abandon ship
in the middle of the South China Sea.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,710
Marooned for 39 days.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,010
They must work together to build shelter,
find food, and survive the island.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,810
But ultimately, it is everyone for
themselves.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,210
Every third night, they will hike deep
into the jungle to take part in

6
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,030
the...

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,050
In the end, only one...

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,860
Tensions at Tagi Tribe were on the rise.

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,540
You guys wait for three days fishing.

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,420
It's expected to get on each other's
nerves.

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,340
While at Pagong, the mood was downcast.

12
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,160
I think the camp looks trashy.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,900
Something's gonna have to happen to make
everybody decide to pitch in.

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,420
But at the reward challenge, Pagong
rebounded by winning a special food prize.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,560
Chicken!

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,820
Are you kidding me?

17
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,780
The romance began to bloom.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,980
Colleen has joined me in the forest to
sleep.

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,700
I noticed they seem to be spending their
nights out into the stars.

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,740
I think it's a little romance going on.

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,100
It's all about sex.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,040
Back at Tagi, Dirk was running on empty.

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,440
You're looking like hell.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,920
I definitely lost a lot of muscle mass, a
lot of strength.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,740
And his tribe thought they had the
immunity challenge wrapped up.

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,280
Apparently, we need one rower and the rest
of us are swimming.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm a commercial whitewater raft guide.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,520
I know Jervis can't swim.

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,540
My guess is that they're gonna put him in
the boat rowing.

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,100
I could beat him any day of the week.

31
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,740
But their overconfidence cost them dearly.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,260
That was the winning job!

33
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,940
I got beat by a guy who can't even swim.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,240
Their loss sent them back to tribal
council, where the voting alliance reared

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,220
its ugly head.

36
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,780
Dirk, Travis spoke.

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,900
11 castaways remain.

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,040
Who will be voted off tonight?

39
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,520
Stay 16 on the island.

40
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,200
The survivors are starting to plan for
their future.

41
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,080
Until

42
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,100
they build separate societies and have
established their own routines.

43
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,560
But in the game of survivor, everything
must change.

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,400
Three days from now, the two tribes will
be forced to merge into a single new

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,820
tribe.

46
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,860
Will they continue to vote along old
tribal lines after the merger?

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,920
Or will it be everyone for themselves?

48
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,980
This week's episode finds the impending
merger on everyone's mind.

49
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:34,950
Time.

50
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,250
Change is coming.

51
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,120
People, I don't think they're taking this
seriously.

52
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,150
They think that they're gonna go to their
little mud volcano and give each other

53
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,410
facials.

54
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,610
It's not a T-minus-1 heart.

55
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,100
Not everybody wants to participate in the
chopping of the head.

56
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,820
I can't.

57
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,700
I mean, come on.

58
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,560
It's not too good.

59
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,240
There's not gonna be a trace of that thing
on earth.

60
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,380
I don't have any emotional attachment.

61
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,220
From the moment I saw them, they were
food.

62
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,180
They, you know, they never were pets to
me.

63
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,880
I don't enjoy killing things.

64
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,120
It's not like a thrill to kill something.

65
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,900
But anybody who eats meat has to realize
that somebody killed that.

66
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,100
Someone's killing it for you.

67
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,280
I don't want to watch it die.

68
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,700
I want to have it put on my plate and put
it in front of me.

69
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm missing food the most.

70
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,380
I mean, I could go for some chicken right
now.

71
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,040
Anytime.

72
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,680
Bait.

73
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,820
I don't care.

74
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,340
Food.

75
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,400
Go ahead.

76
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,700
One, two, three.

77
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,180
I just like to ignore that whole act of
preaching.

78
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,960
The whole death part.

79
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,020
Oh, we're gonna eat three chickens in
three days.

80
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,980
Because we want to eat them before we
merge tribes.

81
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,060
We don't want them getting any of our
chickens.

82
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,660
Besides, one of them was pecking the hell
out of me.

83
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,260
It is the one that was pecking me.

84
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,320
Interacted with the chickens as little as
possible.

85
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,980
I'm not petting them, putting them on
leashes, taking them for walks, naming

86
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,780
them and, you know, calling them my very
own.

87
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,000
It does no good to befriend dinner.

88
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
I've never gone through the process of
feeding a chicken, watering a chicken,

89
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,280
then butchering a chicken.

90
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,300
Yum.

91
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,460
It's

92
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,150
greasy.

93
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,890
And it's gonna fry and it's gonna bubble
and...

94
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,190
Mmm, dinner.

95
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,530
Chicken!

96
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,310
Yeah, we're lucky now.

97
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,010
Got my greasy flavor back in my mouth.

98
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,690
People were happy before I know that the
nutrition hit their bodies.

99
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,890
It was, I think, the first really
recognizable piece of protein that people

100
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,190
have had, that, you know, everybody kind
of knew what it was and make you feel like

101
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,210
you chewed on something.

102
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,970
I think, mentally, the chicken was more
important than it was physically.

103
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,390
I mean, we have three chickens.

104
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,070
And we're done eating those.

105
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,330
It's

106
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,810
funny when I hear, how come you're naked
all the time?

107
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,690
I'm naked less than 1% of the time.

108
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,110
I'd like to be naked all the time.

109
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,350
That would be smarter in this 100-degree
weather.

110
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,490
They're

111
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,280
on naked quite a bit.

112
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,240
I think it probably bugs some of the guys.

113
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,340
Seems kind of childish and immature to me
and kind of grandstanding and walking

114
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,420
around on national TV.

115
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,820
Your life, my life, different things.

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Who cares?

117
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,540
Something like that.

118
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,960
He runs around pretty often with clothes
on and he don't thinks nothing of it.

119
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,520
Peachy.

120
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,180
I couldn't care less whether guys or girls
are around.

121
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,080
It doesn't make any difference.

122
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,240
Is there any horny gay man out there that
want a horny guy in the car?

123
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,780
And I know one.

124
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,860
Naked isn't sexual to me.

125
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,880
And it doesn't...

126
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't think of it that way.

127
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,660
It doesn't faze me that way.

128
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,040
So no, I'm pretty comfortable naked.

129
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,460
I don't agree with his lifestyle and I
told him that.

130
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,620
And he probably don't agree with mine.

131
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,960
But anyway, we gotta work together.

132
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,440
Up until this merger anyway.

133
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,920
There's money at stake.

134
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,560
We're all trying to win the pot.

135
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,360
I finally went along with this alliance.

136
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,260
And if I didn't, I'd be out of here
probably the next vote or the one after.

137
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,720
I think with an alliance that we establish
here, we can do very, very well.

138
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,320
If you don't, you're out.

139
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,920
Exactly.

140
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,380
Tell me what option you have, Rudy.

141
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,960
I've been trying to support keeping Rudy
from day one.

142
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,960
I want to bring him along to the next
round where he won't care much and

143
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,260
probably will get voted off before
winning.

144
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,620
You think they wouldn't do it to us?

145
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,680
No, of course they wouldn't.

146
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,500
I don't think somebody's in control of our
group in particular.

147
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,360
I think I'm in control of who's being
voted off.

148
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,800
And I think that's all that matters to me.

149
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,530
Totally dumb statement now that I regret.

150
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,490
You know, it was kind of just to poke at
the girls, give them a little shot.

151
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:36,250
He sets it up first with, don't take
offense to this, but women are the

152
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,390
stupidest things on the planet next to
cows.

153
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,810
Girls are the stupidest thing on the
planet next to cows, was the remark.

154
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:42,910
The

155
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,310
story was, we were talking about
relationships and how guys and girls will

156
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,450
do stupid things if you like the person.

157
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,830
We never got around to the stupid things
guys do.

158
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,530
If you like somebody that much, you'll do
something stupid for them that you should

159
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,190
maybe not do.

160
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,770
We're not as stupid as ours, we're a step
above.

161
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,330
Well, I said, you know, Jervis, I told
those girls that all they had to do was

162
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,990
like, when they write your name on that
piece of paper and hold it up to the

163
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,890
camera, they can look straight into the
lens and go, nooo, he had his mouth

164
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,190
dropped open like he had never considered
that maybe that was not the best thing to

165
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,730
say to a woman who had that much power
over him.

166
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,910
No, I'm being very apologetic because it
was stupid.

167
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:31,270
I mean, after I said it, you know, after I
said it...

168
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,310
He was like in this box with no freaking
way out.

169
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,550
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

170
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,070
If you let them talk long enough, they'll
probably get you out of the box.

171
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,350
They're good for that.

172
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,030
Jervis, he's on a free ride, man.

173
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,430
He's untouchable.

174
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,990
I don't know how he gets through.

175
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,910
He's called the women cows.

176
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,050
He doesn't do stuff half the time.

177
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,370
I haven't done a thing out here since I've
been here, it seems like.

178
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,030
And that's cool.

179
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,590
Joel does the fishing.

180
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,730
He does the paddling.

181
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,090
I'm just out there hanging on the raft
with him.

182
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,050
The expert fisherman that I am.

183
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,770
When they built that hut on the beach, I
was nowhere near there.

184
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,330
I was in the shade somewhere.

185
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,610
You know, I was looking for a coconut or
something.

186
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,470
I think everybody has done cooking rice at
one point in time.

187
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,630
I have yet to cook anything.

188
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,330
I didn't see him do anything yesterday.

189
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,850
But that is nothing new and that surprises
me that I still haven't voted for Jervis.

190
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,190
He doesn't seem to pull his own weight and
I know for a fact that he voted against

191
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:44,470
me.

192
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,150
So why the hell have I voted for him?

193
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,770
I don't know.

194
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,930
I knew coming here was all about charm and
personality.

195
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,570
That would get me through.

196
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,670
The Tagi tribe has lost the last two
reward challenges and they're growing more

197
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,710
hungry each day.

198
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,370
But tonight there is another reward
challenge for food.

199
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,570
Smell anything yet?

200
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,450
Larvae and tomato sauce.

201
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:22,890
Nice.

202
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,310
I know.

203
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,690
We don't know if it's even his food.

204
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,630
Maybe it's water.

205
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,120
Ruin that chicken with damn dog food.

206
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,240
Go for it.

207
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,820
Exactly.

208
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,250
Coat, nice and shiny.

209
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,270
Yeah, your hair will look good.

210
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,390
Here, take a taste.

211
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,950
Be a man.

212
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,850
Put your finger in there and eat it.

213
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,470
Are you gonna eat it with me?

214
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:02,550
I

215
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,080
choose my preservatives and chemicals
wisely and that really would have thrown

216
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,020
everything off balance.

217
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,540
Your standards definitely, definitely take
a dive when you come to a situation like

218
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:30,680
this.

219
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,180
When you get hungry, you'll eat anything.

220
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,080
At

221
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,780
tonight's reward challenge, we're gonna
find out just how motivated our hungry

222
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,500
tribes are.

223
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,600
During

224
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,230
World War II, this area was a hotspot of
military activity.

225
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,390
So, the premise of this challenge?

226
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,570
Fleeing troops have just abandoned their
barracks and left behind some very useful

227
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,050
items.

228
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:10,110
Two can openers, two pocket knives, and
two army helmets.

229
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,750
One member from each tribe will go in
together, they'll have a flashlight,

230
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,250
you'll look for these items.

231
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,690
You can only find one item per person.

232
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,510
You come back out, you hand off the
flashlight which sort of acts like a baton

233
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,990
to the next person and they go in.

234
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,910
Be careful, if you bring back a duplicate
item, your tribe will be disqualified.

235
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,170
There's a little bit about what you're
playing for tonight.

236
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,450
We've got some good canned food.

237
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,530
Peas, some tuna, a little dessert.

238
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,770
Is that chocolate?

239
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,550
That is chocolate.

240
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,350
First tribe back, with all the items on
the list, wins.

241
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,650
You guys ready?

242
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,130
We can stick together, really, as Pagong
still and just...

243
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,070
Colleen, she said that she does not want
to vote anybody in our team off until all

244
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,950
of their team is gone.

245
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,930
We want to stick together.

246
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,450
But Jenna also has said that she is not
going to vote anybody in our team off.

247
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,810
Greg said openly that he's not going to
vote anybody in the team off.

248
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,010
Jervis has said it openly.

249
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,890
I've said it numerous times openly.

250
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,650
I've never heard Gretchen say, I want to
keep this team together.

251
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,650
What do you think?

252
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:32,810
I

253
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,700
don't see myself joining a voting
alliance.

254
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,020
But if it's somebody that I'm thinking of
voting off, that would be great.

255
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,100
I'll vote along with everybody else.

256
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,560
If we win and we go in with an advantage,
we just all got to stick together, stay as

257
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,180
a team like we've been doing all the
while.

258
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,200
Joel seems to be ignoring the fact that we
combine the tribes.

259
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,600
And if we lose it, somebody is being voted
off.

260
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,860
And he talks way too much about what he's
going to do when the tribes are combined,

261
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,480
the strategy, the combination.

262
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,940
What if he doesn't make it to the
combining of the tribes?

263
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,520
I know that ladies' man has irritated
every woman in his tribe.

264
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm not a chauvinist.

265
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,500
I believe that a woman can do anything a
man can do.

266
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,240
Joel thinks he's the All-American and all
of these physical challenges are just

267
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,120
feeding his ego.

268
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,420
Go ahead.

269
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,660
If you want to compete with me, I'm fine
with it.

270
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,880
I've lost any competitions.

271
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,160
You know, he's golden boy.

272
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,360
He's Mr. January.

273
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,680
He's going to have a calendar.

274
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,180
Think

275
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,710
of anything that I've done that's bad.

276
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,800
To, uh, be pretty condescending.

277
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,080
Like, he has to explain everything so
thoroughly that we just couldn't

278
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,520
understand it without Joel.

279
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,380
Throw it over there.

280
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,280
I know that game he tastes is going to be
pretty harsh.

281
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,880
I don't see why he feels the need to treat
us like we're children.

282
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I wouldn't pry with that.

283
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,860
I wouldn't pry with the tip of that thing.

284
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,280
Do we have a butter knife over there?

285
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,080
He is full of, don't do this, put it here,
do that, watch out, da da da.

286
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,760
Well, then get up and do it.

287
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,940
You can't be a woman who's strong enough
to volunteer to come here and take what

288
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,460
comes.

289
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,800
Do you want me to get that for you?

290
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,060
And then overlook a comment like he
doesn't trust you to cook the rice.

291
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,000
Have we been throwing the water and the
rice in there all at one time?

292
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah.

293
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:42,860
Why?

294
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,260
I just want to, usually at home I boil the
water and then I throw the rice.

295
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,060
A woman just is not capable of doing the
things as good.

296
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,020
As he is.

297
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,560
We'll go without some rice for a little
while and it'll be okay.

298
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,440
And it took us a while to even bring it up
to each other.

299
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,520
But once we did, it's like, oh, you feel
that way too?

300
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,460
And I know that, you know, all three of us
are feeling that.

301
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:03,940
Alright.

302
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,160
I said what I said.

303
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,860
I'm totally square with everything across
the board, whatever anybody thinks.

304
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,540
But no, I definitely am not a chauvinist.

305
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,550
For the last immunity challenge before the
merger, an official U.S.

306
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,670
Army obstacle course has been constructed
by the Green Berets.

307
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,790
Hey Rudy, look behind you.

308
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:47,760
Pushes?

309
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,280
You know, make us work hard for this
victory.

310
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,680
Because we're, I mean, we're coming full
steam ahead at it.

311
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,170
Day 18 on the island.

312
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,850
For the past few days, the tribes have had
their minds on just one thing.

313
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,990
The merger.

314
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,350
Tomorrow, the two tribes become one.

315
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,030
Nobody can predict the impact of
unification.

316
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,250
As new alliances will form, strategies
will change.

317
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,470
That makes today's immunity challenge
critical.

318
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,950
If Tagi loses, they enter the merger
outnumbered by Pagong six to four.

319
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,810
Could then be eliminated by a Pagong
voting alliance.

320
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,870
We're thinking we can do this.

321
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:36,330
On the other hand, if Pagong loses, the
tribes will merge even at five members

322
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:36,630
each.

323
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,270
Joel and Jenna will run the first half of
the course for Pagong.

324
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,410
Sean and Kelly, for Tagi.

325
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,550
They will meet their two fellow tribe
members, Rich and Susan for Tagi, and

326
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,430
Gretchen and Greg for Pagong, at an
obstacle called Blown Bridge.

327
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,970
All four will negotiate this obstacle and
then race to the finish line where the

328
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,890
tribe members who are not participating in
the race, Rudy for Tagi, and Colleen and

329
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,650
Jervis for Pagong, are waiting to cheer
them on.

330
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,910
Yeah!

331
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,750
Survivors ready?

332
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,150
Go!

333
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:14,650
Which

334
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,840
requires them to now stop and think,
because this obstacle involves strategy.

335
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,040
We've got to get up.

336
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,800
Can't touch the middle.

337
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,940
The runners are carrying the instructions
on how to proceed.

338
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,720
We have to start from here.

339
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,780
Each tribe is given four boards of various
links.

340
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:58,360
The object, use the boards to move all
four tribe members across the pylons

341
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,840
without touching the sand.

342
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,020
After you're gonna leave the tops.

343
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:01,740
Oh, really?

344
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,000
We're still shifting boards around here.

345
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,140
Doesn't

346
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,510
matter if they're ahead of you, just take
your time.

347
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,510
Watch your hands.

348
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,350
Never panic.

349
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:28,970
Never panic.

350
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,590
It's already been tenderized.

351
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,960
The console is a necessary part of the
game, but it's the nasty part of the game.

352
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,200
It's the part that I enjoy the least, and
that I could do without.

353
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,940
I don't know who's gonna go.

354
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,100
It could be anybody.

355
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:15,990
Service.

356
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,170
You're just as chauvinistic as Joel.

357
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,700
This game is much too vicious for my
board.

358
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,350
I'm gonna be back at home and be like,
God, that's so easy.

359
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,910
I feel like we're gonna go to tribal
council and vote one person off.

360
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:53,150
Yeah.

361
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,390
I feel like this is the end of our
survivor run here, and we're all about to

362
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,430
go back to our lives, and I won't talk to
these guys.

363
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,350
Another night of reckoning at tribal
council.

364
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,410
So tonight's agenda is the same as always
at tribal council.

365
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,450
You guys will have to vote off one member.

366
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:17,570
So before we get to that, Joel, were you
surprised to lose today?

367
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,270
You know, I don't know if we were really
surprised.

368
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,310
I mean, I knew that we were physically
stronger and faster.

369
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:29,710
We pushed as hard as we could today, and
came up a little bit short this time.

370
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:36,530
It's no big secret about the comments that
were made regarding women in comparison to

371
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,030
an animal.

372
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,070
God, those cows.

373
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,810
What was your take on that, Gretchen?

374
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:47,190
It's being made light of here, but from
what I gathered, it wasn't necessarily

375
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,070
taken all that lightly.

376
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,190
I wasn't there for the initial
conversation.

377
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,410
They were storytelling at night, I think.

378
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,150
And I don't really believe that Jervis...

379
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,650
Oh, were we not supposed to say anything?

380
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,390
Come on!

381
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,810
What do you mean, come on?

382
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,950
You didn't say anything?

383
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,450
You know, Jeff, I do not even recall
saying these words.

384
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,970
Oh, my God.

385
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,490
And you know what?

386
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,190
You know what, Jervis?

387
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,810
Right now is when they are going to play
you saying words.

388
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,270
It sounds so much like Joel, but...

389
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,330
When I listen to it, it sounds so much
like Joel.

390
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,110
Don't let me offend you or anything.

391
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,330
Keep it right over there.

392
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,090
Well, who...

393
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,450
To clear it up from your guys' take on it,
Jenna, who...

394
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,490
Did you link Joel in that group also?

395
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,570
I got linked into this somehow.

396
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,850
I have no idea.

397
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,850
It was this thing.

398
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,650
It kind of linked in.

399
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:41,630
I don't know.

400
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,170
Alright.

401
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,130
Whatever.

402
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,310
Jervis, last time I asked you if you
felt...

403
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,950
If anybody here felt invincible.

404
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,430
You were the first one to pipe up.

405
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,630
You said, I'm not going anywhere.

406
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,270
Still feel that way tonight?

407
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,130
I refuse to answer that question.

408
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,250
On the ground.

409
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,970
That my invincibility may be affected by
that.

410
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,590
So that's a yes.

411
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:06,850
Alright.

412
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:09,650
Yes!

413
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,930
I'm feeling real good tonight.

414
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,630
Why?

415
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,950
Just because, man.

416
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,890
I don't know what it is.

417
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,150
I mean, it might just be me, but...

418
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,930
I'm feeling good.

419
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,110
Anybody here want to own up to feeling a
little...

420
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,350
Uncertain about their future in the next
five to ten minutes?

421
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,840
It's time to vote.

422
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,540
Joel?

423
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,300
I picked Joel for two reasons.

424
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,320
Both small ones.

425
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,700
He seems a bit condescending to women, and
it makes it difficult to work with.

426
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,430
And two, he seems to have the most money
of anybody, so...

427
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,740
I think he needs to win less.

428
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,020
I think towards us ladies.

429
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,060
Moo!

430
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,600
Just a step above a cow.

431
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,850
On the island, fire represents life here
at Tribal Council.

432
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,630
Your torches represent your life, your
identity.

433
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:21,930
Directly across from you are the five
torches from the first five people voted

434
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,250
off.

435
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,750
Tonight, one of your torches will be added
to that group.

436
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,290
I'll go tally the votes.

437
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
Let's read the votes.

438
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,080
First vote.

439
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:08,820
Jenna.

440
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,120
Two votes for Joel, two votes for Jenna.

441
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,390
Last vote.

442
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,830
The rest of you guys, a whole new ball
game tomorrow.

443
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,030
Two tribes will merge into one.

444
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,450
You can head back to your camp.

445
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,910
We'll talk tomorrow.

446
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,050
Good night.

447
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,900
Next week on Survivor.

448
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,560
The two tribes merge into one.

449
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,420
I think it'll be interesting.

450
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,070
I think it'll set up a whole nother set of
interpersonal dynamics.

451
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,300
This group is going to work out so well.

452
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,860
The whole ten.

453
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,700
This new group is like...

454
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,540
It's like a banquet.

455
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,300
Personally, it's a pain in the ass.

456
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,540
If you want to win this money, you gotta
get a little dirty.

457
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,700
I wish I could've made it a little longer.

458
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,500
I think maybe the girls on the team maybe
had a little inferiority complex.

459
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,860
That they took some of these remarks
wrong.

460
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,520
They think I'm a chauvinist.

461
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,440
I'm definitely not.

462
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,700
I mean, so that is my main regret.

463
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,560
That I'm gonna leave here and I got, you
know, four people that think I'm a

464
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,060
chauvinist.

465
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,020
I'm a chauvinist.

466
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,920
You know, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm going
to die.
